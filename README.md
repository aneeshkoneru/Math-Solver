# Math-Solver
The Handwritten Math Evaluator is a Python-based calculator that interprets and solves user-inputted math expressions. It supports operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, and square roots, while ensuring safe evaluation. Results are instant, accurate, and stored locally.
The Handwritten Math Evaluator is a comprehensive Python command-line application designed to interpret and solve mathematical expressions entered in a natural, handwritten-like format. It allows users to input arithmetic expressions such as 2+3*(4-1), powers using the caret symbol like 2^3, and functions such as sqrt(), sin(), cos(), tan(), ln(), and log. The program safely parses and evaluates these expressions by first validating that only permitted characters and symbols are present, then converting the caret (^) into Python’s exponentiation operator (**) for accurate computation. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, parentheses for controlling order of operations, unary minus, implicit multiplication (e.g., 3x or (x+1)(x-1)), and mathematical constants like pi and e. Users receive immediate, precise results along with detailed error messages if an invalid or malformed expression is entered, ensuring a safe and reliable experience. Beyond numeric calculations, the evaluator can also solve linear equations in one variable (x) by interpreting each side as a combination of constants and coefficients, automatically rearranging terms, and solving for x, displaying each algebraic step when requested. The program is lightweight, works completely offline, and requires no external libraries beyond Python’s standard math and re modules. To use the evaluator, simply run the Python script, enter a mathematical expression or linear equation, and view the result, while optionally enabling step-by-step explanations to observe how the expression is tokenized, converted to postfix (RPN), and evaluated. Examples of supported expressions include arithmetic operations like 2+3*(4-1), powers and roots like 2^3 + sqrt(16), implicit multiplication such as 3(x+2), and linear equations such as 4x+2=18. This tool is ideal for students, educators, or anyone needing a quick, accurate, and transparent method for evaluating mathematical expressions, learning order of operations, and understanding the steps involved in solving equations. Future enhancements could expand its capabilities to include full quadratic and polynomial equation solving, more advanced function support, detailed algebraic simplifications, and a history log for tracking previously entered expressions and results, making the Handwritten Math Evaluator an increasingly powerful and educational tool for personal and academic use.
